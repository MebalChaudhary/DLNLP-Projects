# Poetry Generator (RNN Markov)
This Projects builds model to generate new verses in the style of the poems by using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) and Markov Chains.

The Keras.LSTM functions (Recurrent Neural Networks) are used to predict the properties of the next line of the poem (for example, the number of syllables and the rhyme scheme), so that an appropriate new sentence can be chosen. The Markovify functions (Markov Chains) are used to build new sentences (based off of word1=>word2 probabilities) from the setences that were generated with Markovify.

In order to genrate a new poetry for this project, the vocabulary and rhyme schemes of rappers: Notorious B.I.G. and Lil Wayne are taken into consideration.
